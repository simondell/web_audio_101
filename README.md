# Web Audio 101

A drum-machine with basic sequencer to get a feel for launching and mixing sounds, stringing them together in time, building an app rather than a document (because I usually make documents for my day-job, even when they're made like a SPA). Potentially, this project could be used to learn about FRP, as well, as the interface is crying out for better code aesthestics, but this is for a later stage.



## See the demo

Eventually the built site will be hosted somewhere. For now, clone to a local copy.

`$ git clone https://github.com/simondell/web_audio_101.git`

... then run

`$ npm install`
`$ gulp server`

... then point Chrome, Safari or Firefox to

http://localhost:8080 or http://<your_ip>:8080
